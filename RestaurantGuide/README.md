RestaurantGuide (Xamarin.Forms)
=========

This sample is an updated version of [RestaurantGuide](https://github.com/conceptdev/RestaurantGuide/) from 2011. This version uses [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) and [Razor cshtml templates](http://blog.xamarin.com/sharper-html-hybrid-apps-with-razor/).

As with the old version, the text is obfuscated (since it's only a demo). The list screen is a native UITableView/Android ListView and the detail view uses the platform's native web view to display a Razor-generated Html.

I'll spend a little more time formatting the list, but this literally took 10 minutes with Xamarin.Forms :)
